    <h1>About CodeNameZ</h1>
    <p>
     The program itself is a assignment for us, it is a team project that contains technologies
     like Python, Django, HTML, CSS,Javascript, JQuery and AJAX.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective of this program</h2>

    <p>The objective of our application is to provide the users around the world a way to connect with friends and
        play the Codenames Board Game over the internet
    </p>

    <h3>Details of process</h3>

    <p>Players will be able to create private or public games,
invite other players, join other games or just relax and
spectate.
Any game created requires a minimum of 2 players per
team. After filling all the spots, a new round will be
automatically generated and teams will be paired
randomly or as selected by the game owner.
Two spymasters will then be chosen and the first turn of
the round begins. The winner team is the one that
contacts all their secret agents first. The game owner can
set the game to have limited rounds/time per round,
infinite amount of clues or other custom rules that will
lead one team or the other to the victory.</p>
    <p>The game also provides the possibility to move through
the round’s previous turns allowing players to review
their decisions that led to that outcome.
When any of the team is victorious, every member of the
team will receive a number of points based on how fast
they managed to find the agents and win the game. The
losing team will be deducted the same amount of points
minus the points they earned.
Any player is able to access his profile and any other
player’s profile which displays the information about his
account and how successful has he been at the game.
They can also change their user avatar and other trivial
information to personalize their profile.</p>
